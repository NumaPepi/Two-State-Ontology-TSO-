# Two State Ontology-TSO

This repository collects theoretical notes, Qiskit experiments, and analysis related to the Two-State Ontology (TSO) framework.

## A Single Framework for Quantum and Classical Physics

Two-State Ontology (TSO) proposes that quantum and classical behavior are not fundamentally different.  
They may represent phases of the same underlying dynamics, separated by a critical transition threshold.

TSO does not attempt to replace existing physics frameworks.  
Instead, it aims to provide a geometric and informational structure that connects quantum mechanics and relativity at phase boundaries.

## Core Testable Claim

Energy shifts near quantum critical points scale approximately linearly with information content:

ΔE ∝ ΔS_info

where:

- ΔE = energy shift near a phase/measurement boundary  
- ΔS_info = change in informational entropy or accessible state information

## Experimental Status

Preliminary tests using IBM Quantum hardware have explored this relationship
through GHZ-state fidelity scaling, topology-dependent decoherence experiments,
and related circuit analyses.

Early results show encouraging correlation with TSO predictions
(e.g., 11 of 12 tested predictions consistent within experimental uncertainty),
though further replication and independent validation are ongoing.
